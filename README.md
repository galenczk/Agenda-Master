# Agenda Master - The Project Management Database Tool

Agenda Master is the database management tool of a fictional software development company.  This company uses MariaDB to store information on customers, projects, developers, tasks, and developer's certifications.  Agenda Master allows users to conduct CRUD operations on these database entries.

I built Agenda Master in collaboration with Ashwini Chawla for Introduction to Databases at Oregon State University.

We employed dynamic routing in React to present "dashboard" pages for several of the database entities.  These dashboards allowed for the relationships between entities to be displayed conveniently, as well as the CRUD operations that impact these relationships to be accessed.

## Build

Agenda Master was built using React, MySql and MariaDB, Express, and Node.  We also used TailwindCSS for styling.

## Hosting Issues
During the Fall 2022 school term, this project was hosted on the OSU servers.  Because this term is over, all hosting on these servers has been taken down.
Agenda Master is not currently hosted anywhere.
