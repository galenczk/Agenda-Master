- Style tables better, smaller rows with some background color to differentiate

- ProjectTable/Project is reused on CustomersPage, delete button needs to have a prop.
Or have different components for each page, and organize these into folders.

- Delete should have a confirmation attached to it.

- Can the display tables have sorting buttons on columns?
